* Input `https://github.com/KKosty4ka/NodeWorldOfText` as the GitHub URL. Make sure the language is set to `Node.js` and import the repository. ![image info](./readme_images/2.png)
* When it finished importing, open the `Git` tool, and switch to the `for-repl-it` branch. If it asks you to overwrite some changes, click `Overwrite and continue`. ![image info](./readme_images/4.png)
* Click the big green `Run` button.
* Create your account when it asks you to. It will become OP. ![image info](./readme_images/5.png)
